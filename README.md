Hey there! I'm **Evan Hollingshead**, a passionate and driven **Computer Science student** at the **University of Nevada, Las Vegas**, currently in my senior year pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**. I thrive on solving complex problems, building efficient systems, and creating software that makes an impact. With a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and systems design, I'm eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges in **software engineering** and **cybersecurity**.

I enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve, whether it's developing compilers, optimizing algorithms, or designing secure systems. I'm always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to innovative solutions. Currently, I'm seeking **internship opportunities** to further hone my skills, gain hands-on experience, and make meaningful contributions to the tech industry.
