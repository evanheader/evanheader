Hey there! I'm Evan Hollingshead, a passionate and driven Computer Science student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, currently in my senior year pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I love solving complex problems, building efficient systems, and creating software that makes an impact. With a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and data structures, I'm eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges in software engineering.

I enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. I'm always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to innovative solutions. Currently, I'm seeking internship opportunities to further hone my skills, gain hands-on experience, and make meaningful contributions to the tech industry.
